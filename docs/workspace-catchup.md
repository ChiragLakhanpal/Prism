# Workspace catch-up

Some steps must run on the shared Databricks workspace or in Azure. They could not run when their ticket merged, because `.env` had no credentials yet. Run them in order once the wizard from ticket 03 has filled `.env`. Each block names the ticket, the command to run, and what shows that it worked.

Check which keys are set first:

    python3 .claude/hooks/guard.py --env-keys

The merger appends a block below each time it parks a step.
